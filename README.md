**A primitive "Mobidziennik" web scraper combined with AI**

This project demonstrates the basics of **web scraping** and **AI integration** in Python.  
It automatically logs into the Mobidziennik website, scrapes test data, and uses OpenRouterâ€™s AI model to generate helpful notes.

### Features:
- [x] Loggins automaticly after inputing login/password
- [x] Scrapes target site containing data about assigned tests
- [x] Utilizes OpenRouter AI (deepseek-chat-v3.1:free)
- [x] Prints notes for selected test

      

Notes are generated in **Polish**, since the target website is in Polish.  
Users must paste their **OpenRouter API key** directly into the code.


The /src/page_source.txt file contains a sample HTML response returned by the target website.
